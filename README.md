Applied multiple image processing techniques to identify and locate sensors within the image matrix.
Data Collection and Processing:

Analyzed and processed the data collected from the sensors to ensure accuracy and reliability.
Prepared the data for integration into Machine Learning (ML) models.
Machine Learning (ML):

Tested and fine-tuned ML models for gas detection using the processed sensor data.
Explored different ML algorithms to optimize detection accuracy.
Application Development:

Engineered an application to facilitate data collection from sensors in real-time.
Integrated the sensor detection algorithm into the application to automate the extraction of sensor data.
Outcome:
The resulting system offers an efficient and intelligent solution for gas detection, combining advanced sensor detection algorithms with machine learning models. The application streamlines the process of collecting and analyzing sensor data, providing a comprehensive tool for gas monitoring.

Note:
This repository serves as a comprehensive resource documenting the entire development process, from the initial sensor detection algorithm to the application's final implementation.
